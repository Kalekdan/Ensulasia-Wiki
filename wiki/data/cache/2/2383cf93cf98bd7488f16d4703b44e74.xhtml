Not as common as <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=races:elves" class="wikilink1" title="races:elves">Elves</a> and <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=races:humans" class="wikilink1" title="races:humans">Humans</a>, giants are more often from smaller independent tribes and do not tend to live amongst the larger civilizations.
