<p>
The Glitor Frog is an amphibious creature with webbing between its front and rear legs allowing it to glide between the trees where it spends most of its time. It eats flies and other small insects which it catches by launching its tongue out of its mouth and pulling them into its mouth using the sticky surface of its tongue. It is also able to do this whilst gliding making it able to catch insects a long way from any surface.
