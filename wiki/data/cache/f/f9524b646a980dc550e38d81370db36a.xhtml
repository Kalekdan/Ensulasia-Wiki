<p>
Ensulasia is a fantasy world where <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=magic" class="wikilink1" title="magic">magic</a> and the flow of the magical energy through nature is a key element in society.
The use of magic was banned after the murder of <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=emptylink" class="wikilink2" title="emptylink" rel="nofollow">emptyLink</a> at the hands of some dark mages.
The line of emperors were largely respected by the people of Ensulasia until the banning of magic. This was such a major change to their way of life and practically halted many religions. An outsider in Ensulasia would likely see happy and content citizens but behind the curtains the empire now rule with an iron fist in a velvet glove. The emperor now in charge is a paranoid man, and despite no admission of such occurences, those who oppose or speak out against the empire, or even are not thought to be entirely happy with their reign, often disappear unexpectedly.
