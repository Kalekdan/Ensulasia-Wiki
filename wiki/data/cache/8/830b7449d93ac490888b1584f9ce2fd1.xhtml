The salt dwellers are an indigenous group who live in the many caves along the east and southern coasts of <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=ensulasia" class="wikilink1" title="ensulasia">Ensulasia</a>. They are most active during the night and are therefore not seen often. In appearance, they are very similar to <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=races:humans" class="wikilink1" title="races:humans">humans</a> although they have larger eyes and webbed digits. They are also able to stay underwater for significantly longer than a human, up to 10 minutes on a single dive. It is thought therefore that they are a <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=races:hybrid_races" class="wikilink1" title="races:hybrid_races">hybrid</a> between <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=races:humans" class="wikilink1" title="races:humans">humans</a> and <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=races:mer-people" class="wikilink1" title="races:mer-people">mer-people</a> many generations back.
