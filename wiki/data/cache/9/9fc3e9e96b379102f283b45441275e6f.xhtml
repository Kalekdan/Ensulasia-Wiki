<p>
A Cortise is a large horse like creature with two large horns running up the center of its nose. An adult Cortise is 6-8m tall and its diet consists mainly of grasses and shrubbery. In the wild they live in groups of 4 or 5 adults with a single male and the rest females. The horns are used in fights between rivals but also offer protection from predators. If they feel threatened, a group of Cortises will stand in a circle all facing outwards to form a relatively impenetrable circle.
