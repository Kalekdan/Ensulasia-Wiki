====== The Civil War ======
When the usage of magic was banned in [[:Ensulasia]], many peoples way of life was completely turned on its head. Not only is magic a deeply important thing to many Ensulasians on a spiritual level, but many people relied on it for their professions and to support their families. The initial uproar was huge but soon people realized that protesting was not making any changes (if anything it was hurting as people would be beaten in the streets or go missing over night). After a few months, things appeared to settle but several underground revolutionary groups started plotting to plot rebellion in secret. Just over a year later, war broke out when an attack was launched on [[:emptyLink]] (the castle in which the emperor resides). Much of the building was burnt down but the emperor was not hurt.

The ensuing conflict was brutal and lasted for a few years. Soon people realized that fighting to conquer [[:Places:Tharmouth]] was useless (the empires grasp here was too much) and many smaller groups of the rebellion fractured off and retreated into their own territories spread around [[:Ensulasia]]. From these new strongholds, the conflict continued. Whilst never being fully concluded, the large scale battles do not occur as much any more and fights only break out if members from one [[:guilds and factions|faction]] cross into what is considered territory of another. Attacks are mounted from time to time but as a whole, the war is largely at a stalemate, fluctuating back and forth between the leading groups.
