    * The most prevalent group of travellers are known to most as simply [[Guilds and Factions:the Old Folk]]. Their culture is based around maintaining the traditional way of life where magic is at the centre of their society and daily routines. They began after the time of the banning of magic when they refused to part with their way of life. Rebels for a while and still hunted by the state, they move from location to location to evade capture. At one point in their history, a large ambush was set up at a location they were arriving at (it is thought one of the younger Old Folk was persuaded by the empire to betray them in return for gold and riches) and many of their numbers were executed. Those that escaped agreed to split into smaller travelling groups, as they are today, so they cannot be stopped all at once. They are not an aggressive people and wish simply to maintain what they have but do not take kindly to outsiders, especially those that ask questions. Raids on [[Guilds and Factions: the Old Folk]] have been rarer in recent years despite their failure to comply with the laws on magic. They are not seen as an outward threat and the state now tend to expend their resources elsewhere. Some fear however that the state may be preparing to mount an even larger attack and stop the [[Guilds and Factions: the Old Folk]] for good...
