====== Mazoon ======
An [[:races:elves|Elfish]] man originally from [[:places:Hapeston]], Mazoon trained as a bard and traveled around [[:Ensulasia]] performing in many different venues. Since the [[:notableevents:Civil War]] however, Mazoon tends to stick to performing in inns and buildings closer to his hometown in the south west. He is generally oblivious to the politics which caused the war but has found his "pro-empire" songs to not go down to well when he ventures further nowadays (see [[:emptyLink]] //- link to song//).
His most common spot for performing is [[:places:The Grey Dog]] in [[:places:Tharmouth]].
