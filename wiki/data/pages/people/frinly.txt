====== Frinly ======
An elderly [[:races:humans|human]] man, and the owner and barkeep at [[:places:The Grey Dog]], Frinly has lived in [[:places:Tharmouth]] all his life. Frinly is a strong advocate for the empire and will often talk of their greatness whilst serving at his bar. He lives alone having lost his children and wife during the [[:notableevents:Civil War]] when they were found to be practicing magic. He claims he lost all respect for them for defying the emperor but many believe this frail old man speaks well of the empire and ill of his family to protect himself from any repercussions.

Since he has lived here all his life, Frinly knows the names and stories of virtually all the people who come into his bar. He is always curious about strangers but can provide information about almost anyone from [[:places:Tharmouth]].
