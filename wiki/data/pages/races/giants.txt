====== Giants ======
Not as common as [[:races:Elves]] and [[:races:Humans]], giants are more often from smaller independent tribes and do not tend to live amongst the larger civilizations. There are some giants who live with the other races, and some settlements where they are more accepted, but in general, many people in [[:Ensulasia]] do not trust the giants and consider them a threat to their way of life.

Giants are around 10ft tall as an adult. They are some of the best craftsmen of weapons and armor, contested only perhaps by the [[:races:Elves]].
