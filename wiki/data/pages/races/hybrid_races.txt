====== Hybrid races ======
It is not uncommon for many of the humanoid [[:races]] in [[:Ensulasia]] to breed together, though many citizens of Ensulasia, particularly those close to the empire are not keen on this. The indigenous group known as the [[:guilds_and_factions:salt dwellers]] are thought to be a hybrid race between the [[:races:humans]] and [[:races:mer-people]] resulting in highly specialized aquatic night hunters.
