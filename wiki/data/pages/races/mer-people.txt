====== Mer-people ======
The mer-people are a [[:races|race]] of aquatic humanoids who live in the seas around [[:Ensulasia]] as well as in some of the larger lakes inland.
They have large eyes which allow them to see better in low light deep underwater. They also have webbed fingers and toes with longer digits which helps to propel them through the water. They are able to breath underwater and thus spend most of their time there, but they are also able to spend short a short amount of time (around 1 day) out of the water.
