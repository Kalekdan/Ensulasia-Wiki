====== Salt Dwellers ======
The salt dwellers are an indigenous group who live in the many caves along the east and southern coasts of [[:Ensulasia]]. They are most active during the night and are therefore not seen often. In appearance, they are very similar to [[:races:humans]] although they have larger eyes and webbed digits. They are also able to stay underwater for significantly longer than a human, up to 10 minutes on a single dive. It is thought therefore that they are a [[:races:hybrid races|hybrid]] between [[:races:humans]] and [[:races:mer-people]] many generations back.
