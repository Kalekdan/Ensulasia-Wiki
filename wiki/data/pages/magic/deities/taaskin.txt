====== Taaskin ======
Taaskin is the [[:emptyLink]] god of harvest. He is one of the most prayed to [[:magic:deities]] as he helps the vast agricultural population of [[:Ensulasia]]. He is often portrayed as an elderly man with curled ram horns and a shepherds crook in hand.
To earn favor with Taaskin many farmers hold regular ceremonies to him and will offer a portion of their yield as thanks, either through burning of crops, or animal sacrifices.
