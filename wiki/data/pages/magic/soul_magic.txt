====== Soul Magic ======
Whilst not strictly magic, soul magic is a means of achieving magic-like abilities and powers without earning it through favor with a magical being or through study of the life-force in all living creatures. Soul magic is, and always has been, even before the banning of magic as a whole, a forbidden art. The strength of one who studies soul magic receives comes from draining magic essence from living things. This is done through inflicting suffering and even causing death. The purer the creature you kill, and the stronger the bond you have between them, the more strength you will be able to draw from them.
