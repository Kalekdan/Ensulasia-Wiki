====== Skywood Trees ======
Thought to be the largest living things in [[:Ensulasia]], the Skywood trees are immensely tall trees that can sometimes reach beyond the clouds. An adult Skywood can have a trunk diameter of around 50m and can grow up to 2000m. They have a ghostly grey color bark at the base and will sprout small offshoots around ever 50-100m up. If a Skywood reaches beyond the cloud level, they will stop gaining height and instead spread into a relatively flat, web like structure with partially translucent leaves.

The wood from an adult Skywood tree is incredibly strong and as such is a very valuable material. Chopping down an adult Skywood is dangerous and difficult due to their size and the toughness of the wood. More often they are "mined" and have tunnels carved through them in order to extract some of the wood but this is a very expensive process. The indigenous [[:emptyLink]] have build their homes inside Skywood trees for generations but it is not known how they are able to do so or how extensive their constructions are. It is thought that they use rudimentary forms of magic to carve into the trees.

A vast forest of Skywood trees exists on the western shore of [[:Ensulasia]] but other than that they are rare to find on their own.
